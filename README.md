# Detection-of-duplicate-threads-on-Q-A-websites
The number of questions asked on question and answer (Q&amp;A) forums like Stack Overflow, Quora, and Twitter, is increasing rapidly. Millions of users visit these sites each month and post their questions. It is no surprise that many of these questions are duplicates. Users may have to wait for a long time to get answers to their questions even though related questions have already been answered. So, it is important to have an automatic way of identifying duplicate threads. Quora, on the other hand, uses a Xgboost model to identify duplicate questions. In this research, we have built a ML model using word2vec from Gensim, trained on Googleâ€™s 3 million word news dataset. For dimensionality reduction in preprocessing we are choosing TSNE rather than PCA. For detection of word similarity TF-IDF,BOW,WORD2VEC would be used. For test and Train data classification Logistic regression, Adaboost and Xgboost would be used.
